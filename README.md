## Cthulhu's Setup Scripts
A collection of Linux setup scripts that will install my favourite programs and other tools

# Available for:

1. Red Hat-based (RHEL, Fedora, CentOS)
2. Debain-based  (Ubuntu, Mint, Pop!-OS)
3. Arch-based    (Arch, Manjaro, EndeavourOS)
5. Gentoo
6. NixOS
7. openSUSE

Please note: I primarily use Debain and Red Hat-based distros. Any issues with the others raise an issue and I'll take a look

To Install: 

1. Download 'setup.sh'
2. Make the script executable by running 'chmod +x setup.sh' in the terminal.
3. Run the script with ./setup.sh in the terminal
